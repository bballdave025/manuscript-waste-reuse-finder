# manuscript-waste-reuse-finder

Code and research description to be presented at the 2024 [Family History Technology Conference](https://fhtw.byu.edu/). Research and Development on a tool to find document images where manuscript waste (a.k.a. binder's waste, somewhat-a.k.a. manuscript fragments) was used to bind other documents. Such reused manuscripts have been found to contain info relating to such diverse fields as genealogy and family history, manuscript studies, paleography, codicology, and of course fragmentology. It will be shown that it is extendable to finding such things as manuscript repairs (e.g. stitching) and iron-gall-ink corrosion.
