# manuscript-waste-reuse-finder

Code and research description to be presented at the 2024 [Family History Technology Conference](https://fhtw.byu.edu/). Research and Development on a tool to find document images where manuscript waste (a.k.a. binder's waste, somewhat-a.k.a. manuscript fragments) was used to bind other documents. Such reused manuscripts have been found to contain info relating to such diverse fields as genealogy and family history, manuscript studies, paleography, codicology, and of course fragmentology. It will be shown that it is extendable to finding such things as manuscript repairs (e.g. stitching) and iron-gall-ink corrosion.

## Examples of Reused Manuscript Fragments (and of what are not so classified)

Before my description of the tool, I want to put here several images that illustrate Reused Manuscript Fragments. "Reused Manuscript Fragments" will be the term I use to describe what this tool is designed to find. I will also use <b>RMF</b> and such phrases as, "examples of reuse".


### Example 1 : Universit√§tsbibliothek Heidelberg, Codex Salemitana VII,73

Title: Ordinarium cisterciense
